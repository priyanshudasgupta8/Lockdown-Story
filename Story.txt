There was once a boy called Ronald, he was very bored in lockdown. Unfortunately for him, he loved going to school. But there he was, stuck at home for 8 months. Although he went for small trips here and there with his family, he was still finding it hard to enjoy himself. His best friends, Richard and Ryle, were experiencing something similar. Ronald kept thinking why did he have to be in 8th grade in 2020. Why couldn't he be born in 2020, he wouldn't have to deal with any of this. His small group of friends hadn't seen each other in 9 months now, as Summer started a month before and the last day of 7th grade was their last meeting in hardware.
